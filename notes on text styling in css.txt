in the css there are different types of text writing properties.
they are
           text align
            text transform
           text shadow: to create some shadow for the content we use text shadow
                  this text shadow is a short hand property it means there is no need to mention text shadow -horizontal and text shadow vertical we can mention text shadow
        text -shadow : 2px 2px 3px   here 3px or the third value represents the blur value and it makes the text shadow blurr. and if we doesnot mention any third value then the shadow won't be blur.
